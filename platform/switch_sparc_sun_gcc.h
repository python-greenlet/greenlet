 * this is the internal transfer function.
 *
 * HISTORY
 * 08-Mar-11  Floris Bruynooghe <flub@devork.be>
 *      No need to set return value register explicitly
 *      before the stack and framepointer are adjusted
 *      as none of the other registers are influenced by
 *      this.  Also don't needlessly clean the windows
 *      ('ta %0" :: "i" (ST_CLEAN_WINDOWS)') as that
 *      clobbers the gcc PIC register (%l7).
 * 24-Nov-02  Christian Tismer  <tismer@tismer.com>
 *      needed to add another magic constant to insure
 *      that f in slp_eval_frame(PyFrameObject *f)
 *      STACK_REFPLUS will probably be 1 in most cases.
 *      gets included into the saved stack area.
 * 17-Sep-02  Christian Tismer  <tismer@tismer.com>
 *      after virtualizing stack save/restore, the
 *      stack size shrunk a bit. Needed to introduce
 *      an adjustment STACK_MAGIC per platform.
 * 15-Sep-02  Gerd Woetzel       <gerd.woetzel@GMD.DE>
 *      added support for SunOS sparc with gcc
