2.0.0a2 (unreleased)
====================

- Nothing changed yet.


2.0.0a1 (2022-01-20)
====================

Platforms
---------

- Add experimental, untested support for 64-bit Windows on ARM using
  MSVC. See `PR 271 <https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/pull/271>`_.

- Drop support for very old versions of GCC and MSVC.

- Compilation now requires a compiler that either supports C++11 or
  has some other intrinsic way to create thread local variables; for
  older GCC, clang and SunStudio we use ``__thread``, while for older
  MSVC we use ``__declspec(thread)``.

- Wheels compatible with the musllinux specification are built,
  tested, and uploaded to PyPI. (This was retroactively done for
  version 1.1.2 as well.)

- This version of greenlet is known to compile and pass tests on
  CPython 3.11.0a4. Earlier or later 3.11 releases may or may not
  work. See `PR 280
  <https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/pull/280>`_. Special
  thanks to Brandt Bucher and the CPython developers.

Fixes
-----

- Fix several leaks that could occur when using greenlets from
  multiple threads. For example, it is no longer necessary to call
  ``getcurrent()`` before exiting a thread to allow its main greenlet
  to be cleaned up. See `issue 252 <https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/issues/251>`_.

- Fix the C API ``PyGreenlet_Throw`` to perform the same error
  checking that the Python API ``greenlet.throw()`` does. Previously,
  it did no error checking.

- Fix C++ exception handling on 32-bit Windows. This might have
  ramifications if you embed Python in your application and also use
  SEH on 32-bit windows, or if you embed Python in a C++ application.
  Please contact the maintainers if you have problems in this area.

  In general, C++ exception handling is expected to be better on most
  platforms. This work is ongoing.

Changes
-------

- The repr of some greenlets has changed. In particular, if the
  greenlet object was running in a thread that has exited, the repr
  now indicates that. *NOTE:* The repr of a greenlet is not part of
  the API and should not be relied upon by production code. It is
  likely to differ in other implementations such as PyPy.

- Main greenlets from threads that have exited are now marked as dead.


1.1.2 (2021-09-29)
==================

- Fix a potential crash due to a reference counting error when Python
  subclasses of ``greenlet.greenlet`` were deallocated. The crash
  became more common on Python 3.10; on earlier versions, silent
  memory corruption could result. See `issue 245
  <https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/issues/245>`_. Patch by
  fygao-wish.
- Fix a leak of a list object when the last reference to a greenlet
  was deleted from some other thread than the one to which it
  belonged. For this to work correctly, you must call a greenlet API
  like ``getcurrent()`` before the thread owning the greenlet exits:
  this is a long-standing limitation that can also lead to the leak of
  a thread's main greenlet if not called; we hope to lift this
  limitation. Note that in some cases this may also fix leaks of
  greenlet objects themselves. See `issue 251
  <https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/issues/251>`_.
- Python 3.10: Tracing or profiling into a spawned greenlet didn't
  work as expected. See `issue 256
  <https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/issues/256>`_, reported
  by Joe Rickerby.

1.1.1 (2021-08-06)
==================

- Provide Windows binary wheels for Python 3.10 (64-bit only).

- Update Python 3.10 wheels to be built against 3.10rc1, where
  applicable.


1.1.0 (2021-05-06)
==================

- Add support for Python 3.10. Pre-built binary wheels for 3.10 are
  not currently available for all platforms. The greenlet ABI is
  different on Python 3.10 from all previous versions, but as 3.10 was
  never supported before, and the ABI has not changed on other Python
  versions, this is not considered a reason to change greenlet's major
  version.


1.0.0 (2021-01-13)
==================

- Fix %s and %r formatting of a greenlet on Python 2. Previously it
  would result in a Unicode string instead of a native string. See
  `issue 218
  <https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/issues/218>`_.

- Move continuous integration from Travis CI to Github Actions.


1.0a1 (2020-11-20)
==================

- Add the ability to set a greenlet's PEP 567 contextvars context
  directly, by assigning to the greenlet's ``gr_context`` attribute.
  This restores support for some patterns of using greenlets atop an
  async environment that became more challenging in 0.4.17. Thanks to
  Joshua Oreman, Mike bayer, and Fantix King, among others. See `PR
  198 <https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/pull/198/>`_.

- The repr of greenlet objects now includes extra information about
  its state. This is purely informative and the details are subject to
  change. See `issue 215 <https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/issues/215>`_.

- The ``greenlet`` module is now a package. There are no API changes,
  so all existing imports, including from C code, should continue to
  work.

- (C API) The undocumented ``GREENLET_VERSION`` macro that defined a string
  giving the greenlet version is now deprecated and will not be updated.

- (Documentation) Publish the change log to https://greenlet.readthedocs.io

Supported Platforms
-------------------

- Drop support for Python 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4.
  The project metadata now includes the ``python_requires`` data to
  help installation tools understand supported versions.
- Add partial support for AIX ppc64 and IBM i. Thanks to Jesse
  Gorzinski and Kevin Adler. See `PR 197
  <https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/pull/197>`_.

Packaging Changes
-----------------

- Require setuptools to build from source.
- Stop asking setuptools to build both .tar.gz and .zip
  sdists. PyPI has standardized on .tar.gz for all platforms.
- Stop using a custom distutils command to build
  extensions. distutils is deprecated.
- Remove the ability to use the deprecated command
  ``python setup.py test``. Run greenlet tests with your favorite
  unittest-compatible test runner, e.g., ``python -m unittest discover
  greenlet.tests``. See `issue 185 <https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/issues/185>`_.
- The directory layout and resulting sdists have changed.
  See `issue 184
  <https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/issues/184>`_.
- greenlet is now always built with support for tracing and garbage
  collection, and, on Python 3.7 and above, support for context
  variables. The internal and undocumented C preprocessor macros that
  could be used to alter that at compile time have been removed (no
  combination other than the defaults was ever tested). This helps
  define a stable ABI.
